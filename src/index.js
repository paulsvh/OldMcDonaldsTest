/**
 * Welcome to Old McDonald's farm.  In this exercise we're going to create a digital
 * representation of the McDonald family farm.
 * Requirements:
 *  1. Create programmatic representations of our barnyarn friends.  This structure is
 *    totally up to you.  Feel free to get creative and use the tools you have available
 *    and any stategy you can think of.
 *  2. Create a "barnyard" programmatic representation.  This model should contain "pens"
 *    for the animals to live.
 *  3. Introduce a basic way of interacting with the animals in our barnyard.  For example,
 *    create a button on the page that would pet the animals which in turn would make a
 *    "noise", (in this case it would print something in the HTML).  Get creative here!
 *    I'd love to see the unique solutions you come up with!
